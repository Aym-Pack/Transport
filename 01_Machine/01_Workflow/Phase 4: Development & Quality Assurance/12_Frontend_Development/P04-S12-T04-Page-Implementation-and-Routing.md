# Mission Statement
Implement application pages and configure routing for DafnckMachine v3.1, ensuring seamless navigation and modular page structure.

# Description
This task covers the creation of main application pages, setup of the routing system, and implementation of navigation logic. The goal is to provide a scalable and maintainable page structure that supports future feature expansion and user flows.

# Super-Prompt
You are @coding-agent responsible for implementing pages and routing for DafnckMachine v3.1. Your mission is to ensure robust navigation, modular page structure, and alignment with the overall frontend architecture.

# MCP Tools Required
- edit_file
- file_search
- list_dir
- run_terminal_cmd
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_get_task
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_set_task_status

# Result We Want
- Core pages implemented with responsive layouts, component integration, and navigation functionality verified and operational.
- Routing system implemented with navigation components, protected routes, and comprehensive application flow verified and functional.

# Add to Brain
- Page structure and layout
- Routing and navigation system
- Protected routes and access control

# Primary Responsible Agent
@coding-agent - frontend-development

# Supporting Agents
- @ui-designer-agent
- @development-orchestrator-agent

# Agent Selection Criteria
@coding-agent is selected for expertise in page and routing implementation. Supporting agents provide UI and workflow guidance.

# Tasks (Summary)
- Implement home, dashboard, user profile, and settings pages
- Integrate responsive layouts and navigation
- Configure routing system and protected routes

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask 1: Core Page Development
- **ID**: P04-T04-S01
- **Description**: Implement essential application pages including home, dashboard, user profile, and settings with responsive layouts and navigation integration.
- **Agent Assignment**: @coding-agent
- **Documentation Links**:
  - [Page_Implementation_Guide.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Page_Implementation_Guide.md)
  - [Layout_Specifications.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Layout_Specifications.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Implement home and dashboard pages with layouts (edit_file)
    2. Implement user profile and settings pages (edit_file)
    3. Verify page functionality and responsive behavior (run_terminal_cmd)
- **Success Criteria**:
    - File Exists: src/pages/Home.jsx
    - File Exists: src/pages/Dashboard.jsx
    - File Content Matches: "responsive"
    - File Content Matches: "layout"
    - File Exists: src/pages/Profile.jsx
    - File Exists: src/pages/Settings.jsx
    - File Content Matches: "form"
    - File Content Matches: "user-data"
    - HTTP Response: GET http://localhost:3000/ returns HTTP 200 OK
    - HTTP Response: GET http://localhost:3000/dashboard returns HTTP 200 OK
    - Output Contains: "Pages rendered successfully"
- **On Failure**: ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN (@ui-designer-agent) with logs
- **Max Retries**: 3
- **Integration Points**: Core pages provide main user interface and application functionality foundation for user interactions.
- **Next Subtask**: P04-T04-S02 (Routing & Navigation Implementation)

## Subtask 2: Routing & Navigation Implementation
- **ID**: P04-T04-S02
- **Description**: Implement comprehensive routing system with navigation components, protected routes, deep linking, and seamless application flow.
- **Agent Assignment**: @coding-agent
- **Documentation Links**:
  - [Routing_Implementation_Guide.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Routing_Implementation_Guide.md)
  - [Navigation_Configuration.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Navigation_Configuration.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Configure routing system and route definitions (edit_file)
    2. Implement protected routes and authentication guards (edit_file)
    3. Verify routing functionality and navigation flow (run_terminal_cmd)
- **Success Criteria**:
    - File Content Matches: "routes.*\["
    - File Content Matches: "path"
    - File Content Matches: "component"
    - File Exists: src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx
    - File Content Matches: "authentication"
    - File Content Matches: "redirect"
    - HTTP Response: GET http://localhost:3000/protected returns appropriate response
    - Output Contains: "Routing system functional"
    - Unit Test Pass: routing-test-suite
- **On Failure**: ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN (@development-orchestrator-agent) with logs
- **Max Retries**: 3
- **Integration Points**: Routing system enables seamless navigation and application flow, providing foundation for user experience and application structure.
- **Next Subtask**: P04-T05-S01 (State Management Implementation)

# Rollback Procedures
- Revert to previous working page or routing configuration
- Escalate to @ui-designer-agent or @development-orchestrator-agent if repeated failures

# Integration Points
- Core pages and routing are central to the frontend application
- Enable user navigation and access control

# Quality Gates
1. All pages must be responsive and accessible
2. Routing and navigation must be robust and secure
3. All tests must pass for pages and routing

# Success Criteria
- Pages and routing system are functional, accessible, and tested

# Risk Mitigation
- Use version control for all page and routing changes
- Validate with automated and manual tests
- Escalate to supporting agents on persistent issues

# Output Artifacts
- Page source files
- Routing and navigation configuration
- Test suites and results

# Next Action
Begin implementation of core pages and routing with @coding-agent

# Post-Completion Action
Update @Step.json and @DNA.json to reflect SUCCEEDED status for this task and proceed to P04-S12-T05-State-Management-and-API-Integration.md
