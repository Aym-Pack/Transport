# Mission Statement
Develop a robust, reusable core component library for DafnckMachine v3.1, ensuring consistency, maintainability, and scalability across the frontend application.

# Description
This task covers the implementation of foundational UI components, documentation of usage patterns, and establishment of best practices for extensibility and testing. The component library should align with the design system and support rapid feature development.

# Super-Prompt
You are @coding-agent responsible for building the core component library for DafnckMachine v3.1. Your mission is to create a set of reusable, well-documented, and easily testable UI components that form the backbone of the application's user interface.

# MCP Tools Required
- edit_file
- file_search
- list_dir
- run_terminal_cmd
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_get_task
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_set_task_status

# Result We Want
- Base component library implemented with accessibility features, responsive design, and comprehensive testing coverage verified and functional.
- Complex component library developed with advanced functionality, sophisticated interactions, and comprehensive testing coverage verified and operational.

# Add to Brain
- Base and complex component implementation
- Accessibility and responsive design
- Advanced UI functionality and interaction patterns

# Primary Responsible Agent
@coding-agent - frontend-development

# Supporting Agents
- @ui-designer-agent

# Agent Selection Criteria
@coding-agent is selected for expertise in component implementation, accessibility, and advanced UI features. @ui-designer-agent supports with design and usability.

# Tasks (Summary)
- Implement foundational base components (buttons, inputs, typography, icons, layout)
- Implement advanced complex components (forms, modals, navigation, data tables, charts)
- Ensure accessibility, responsive design, and comprehensive testing

# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask 1: Base Component Implementation
- **ID**: P04-T03-S01
- **Description**: Implement foundational base components including buttons, inputs, typography, icons, and layout components with accessibility features and responsive design.
- **Agent Assignment**: @coding-agent
- **Documentation Links**:
  - [Base_Components_Library.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Base_Components_Library.md)
  - [Component_Specifications.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Component_Specifications.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Implement button and input components with variants (edit_file)
    2. Implement typography and icon components (edit_file)
    3. Implement layout components and verify functionality (edit_file)
- **Success Criteria**:
    - File Exists: src/components/base/Button.jsx
    - File Exists: src/components/base/Input.jsx
    - File Content Matches: "aria-label"
    - File Content Matches: "variant"
    - File Exists: src/components/base/Typography.jsx
    - File Exists: src/components/base/Icon.jsx
    - File Content Matches: "semantic"
    - File Content Matches: "role"
    - File Exists: src/components/layout/Container.jsx
    - File Exists: src/components/layout/Grid.jsx
    - Unit Test Pass: base-components-test-suite
- **On Failure**: ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN (@ui-designer-agent) with logs
- **Max Retries**: 3
- **Integration Points**: Base components provide foundation for all UI development and enable consistent design implementation across the application.
- **Next Subtask**: P04-T03-S02 (Complex Component Development)

## Subtask 2: Complex Component Development
- **ID**: P04-T03-S02
- **Description**: Develop advanced complex components including forms, modals, navigation, data tables, and charts with sophisticated functionality and interactions.
- **Agent Assignment**: @coding-agent
- **Documentation Links**:
  - [Complex_Components_Library.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Complex_Components_Library.md)
  - [Advanced_Component_Specs.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_4/12_Frontend_Development/Advanced_Component_Specs.json)
- **Steps**:
    1. Implement form and modal components with validation (edit_file)
    2. Implement navigation and data table components (edit_file)
    3. Implement chart components and verify complex functionality (edit_file)
- **Success Criteria**:
    - File Exists: src/components/complex/Form.jsx
    - File Exists: src/components/complex/Modal.jsx
    - File Content Matches: "validation"
    - File Content Matches: "focus-trap"
    - File Exists: src/components/complex/Navigation.jsx
    - File Exists: src/components/complex/DataTable.jsx
    - File Content Matches: "responsive"
    - File Content Matches: "pagination"
    - File Exists: src/components/complex/Chart.jsx
    - File Content Matches: "interactive"
    - Unit Test Pass: complex-components-test-suite
- **On Failure**: ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN (@ui-designer-agent) with logs
- **Max Retries**: 3
- **Integration Points**: Complex components enable feature-rich user interface implementation and provide advanced functionality for application features.
- **Next Subtask**: P04-T04-S01 (Core Page Development)

# Rollback Procedures
- Revert to previous working component versions
- Escalate to @ui-designer-agent if repeated failures

# Integration Points
- Base and complex components are used throughout the frontend application
- Enable rapid feature development and UI consistency

# Quality Gates
1. All components must be accessible and responsive
2. Components must pass all relevant tests
3. Component documentation must be up to date

# Success Criteria
- Component library is functional, accessible, and tested

# Risk Mitigation
- Use version control for all component changes
- Validate with automated and manual tests
- Escalate to supporting agents on persistent issues

# Output Artifacts
- Base and complex component source files
- Component documentation
- Test suites and results

# Next Action
Begin implementation of base and complex components with @coding-agent

# Post-Completion Action
Update @Step.json and @DNA.json to reflect SUCCEEDED status for this task and proceed to P04-S12-T04-Page-Implementation-and-Routing.md
