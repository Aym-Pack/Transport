## Mission Statement
Implement comprehensive business logic layer with service architecture, data validation, and business rule enforcement for scalable application logic.

## Description
This task covers the implementation of the business logic layer, including service architecture, data validation, business rule enforcement, error handling, and logging systems for robust application operation.

## Super-Prompt
You are @coding-agent. Your mission is to implement the business logic layer, service architecture, data validation, business rule enforcement, error handling, and logging for DafnckMachine v3.1 backend.

## MCP Tools Required
- edit_file
- run_terminal_cmd
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_get_task
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_set_task_status

## Result We Want
- Business logic implemented with service layer architecture, validation systems, error handling, logging, and verified functionality for application requirements.

## Add to Brain
- Business Logic: Core application functionality, service architecture, domain modeling, validation, error handling, logging

## Subtasks (Detailed)
### Subtask-01: Business Logic Implementation
- **Agent**: @coding-agent
- **Documentation Links**: Business_Logic_Architecture.md, Service_Layer_Design.json
- **Steps**:
    1. Implement service layer architecture and business logic (edit_file)
        - Success: "service", "business.*logic", "domain"
    2. Configure data validation and business rule enforcement (edit_file)
        - Success: "validation", "rules", "constraints"
    3. Test business logic and service layer functionality (run_terminal_cmd)
        - Success: Exit Code 0, business-logic-test-suite, service-layer-test-suite
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: Business logic implemented with service layer architecture, validation systems, and verified functionality for application requirements.
- **Integration Points**: Provides core functionality for all application features and enforces business rules across the system.
- **Next Subtask**: P04-T05-S02 (Error Handling & Logging Systems)

### Subtask-02: Error Handling & Logging Systems
- **Agent**: @coding-agent
- **Documentation Links**: Error_Handling_Guide.md, Logging_Configuration.json
- **Steps**:
    1. Implement error handling and exception management (edit_file)
        - Success: "error.*handling", "exception", "recovery"
    2. Configure logging system and monitoring integration (edit_file)
        - Success: "logging", "monitor", "structured"
    3. Test error handling and logging functionality (run_terminal_cmd)
        - Success: Exit Code 0, "Error handling verified", error-handling-test-suite
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: Error handling and logging systems implemented with comprehensive coverage, monitoring integration, and verified functionality.
- **Integration Points**: Provides system resilience and operational monitoring and debugging capabilities.
- **Next Subtask**: P04-T06-S01 (Performance Optimization)

## Rollback Procedures
- Revert to previous business logic or error handling implementation
- Restore from backup if failures occur

## Integration Points
- Provides core business logic and error handling foundation for backend

## Quality Gates
- Business logic, error handling, and logging must be functional and tested

## Success Criteria
- Business logic, error handling, and logging are functional, tested, and ready for development

## Risk Mitigation
- Use version control for all business logic and error handling changes
- Validate with automated and manual tests

## Output Artifacts
- Service layer and business logic code
- Error handling and logging code
- Test results and logs

## Next Action
Implement service layer architecture and business logic

## Post-Completion Action
