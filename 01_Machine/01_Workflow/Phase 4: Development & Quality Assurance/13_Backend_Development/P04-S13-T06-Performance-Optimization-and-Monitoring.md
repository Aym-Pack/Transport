## Mission Statement
Implement performance optimization strategies with caching systems, monitoring integration, and scalability enhancements for high-performance backend operation.

## Description
This task covers the implementation of performance optimization, caching strategies, resource management, monitoring, health checks, metrics collection, and alerting for efficient and reliable backend operation.

## Super-Prompt
You are @performance-load-tester-agent (performance optimization) and @health-monitor-agent (monitoring). Your mission is to implement performance optimization, caching, resource management, monitoring, health checks, metrics collection, and alerting for DafnckMachine v3.1 backend.

## MCP Tools Required
- edit_file
- run_terminal_cmd
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_get_task
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_set_task_status

## Result We Want
- Performance optimization implemented with caching systems, resource management, monitoring, health checks, metrics collection, and verified performance improvements.

## Add to Brain
- Performance Optimization: Caching, query optimization, resource management, monitoring, health checks, metrics collection, alerting

## Documentation & Templates
- [Performance_Optimization_Guide.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_4/13_Backend_Development/Performance_Optimization_Guide.md)
- [Caching_Configuration.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_4/13_Backend_Development/Caching_Configuration.json)
- [Monitoring_Implementation.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_4/13_Backend_Development/Monitoring_Implementation.md)
- [Health_Check_Configuration.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_4/13_Backend_Development/Health_Check_Configuration.json)

## Primary Responsible Agent
@performance-load-tester-agent (performance optimization), @health-monitor-agent (monitoring)

## Supporting Agents
- @system-architect-agent
- @test-orchestrator-agent

## Agent Selection Criteria
@performance-load-tester-agent is chosen for performance optimization, caching, and resource management. @health-monitor-agent is responsible for monitoring, health checks, and metrics collection.

## Tasks (Summary)
- Implement caching strategies and query optimization
- Configure resource management and connection pooling
- Test performance optimization and measure improvements
- Implement health check endpoints and system monitoring
- Configure metrics collection and alerting systems
- Test monitoring system and health check functionality

## Subtasks (Detailed)
### Subtask-01: Performance Optimization
- **Agent**: @performance-load-tester-agent
- **Documentation Links**: Performance_Optimization_Guide.md, Caching_Configuration.json
- **Steps**:
    1. Implement caching strategies and query optimization (edit_file)
        - Success: "cache", "optimization", "performance"
    2. Configure resource management and connection pooling (edit_file)
        - Success: "pool", "resource", "memory"
    3. Test performance optimization and measure improvements (run_terminal_cmd)
        - Success: Exit Code 0, "Performance improved", performance-optimization-test-suite
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: Performance optimization implemented with caching systems, resource management, and verified performance improvements.
- **Integration Points**: Enhances overall system responsiveness and provides foundation for scalable operation.
- **Next Subtask**: P04-T06-S02 (Monitoring & Health Checks)

### Subtask-02: Monitoring & Health Checks
- **Agent**: @health-monitor-agent
- **Documentation Links**: Monitoring_Implementation.md, Health_Check_Configuration.json
- **Steps**:
    1. Implement health check endpoints and system monitoring (edit_file)
        - Success: "health", "monitor", "status"
    2. Configure metrics collection and alerting systems (edit_file)
        - Success: "metrics", "alert", "collect"
    3. Test monitoring system and health check functionality (run_terminal_cmd)
        - Success: GET /health 200 OK, "Monitoring active", monitoring-system-test-suite
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: Monitoring and health check systems implemented with comprehensive coverage, metrics collection, and verified operational functionality.
- **Integration Points**: Provides operational visibility and enables proactive system management and reliability assurance.
- **Next Subtask**: P04-S14-T01 (Database Implementation)

## Rollback Procedures
- Revert to previous performance or monitoring configuration
- Restore from backup if failures occur

## Integration Points
- Provides performance optimization and monitoring foundation for backend

## Quality Gates
- Performance optimization and monitoring must be functional and tested

## Success Criteria
- Performance optimization and monitoring are functional, tested, and ready for development

## Risk Mitigation
- Use version control for all performance and monitoring changes
- Validate with automated and manual tests

## Output Artifacts
- Performance optimization code
- Monitoring and health check code
- Test results and logs

## Next Action
Implement caching strategies and query optimization
