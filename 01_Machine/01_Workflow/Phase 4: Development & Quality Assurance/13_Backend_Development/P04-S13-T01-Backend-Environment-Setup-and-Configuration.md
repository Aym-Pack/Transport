## Mission Statement
Establish comprehensive backend development environment with server initialization, framework configuration, and development tools for scalable backend application development.

## Description
This task covers the initialization of the backend development environment, including project structure, dependency management, and server configuration. It ensures the foundation for all subsequent backend development activities.

## Super-Prompt
You are @coding-agent. Your mission is to set up the backend development environment for DafnckMachine v3.1, including project structure, dependency management, and server configuration, to enable scalable backend application development.

## MCP Tools Required
- edit_file
- file_search
- list_dir
- run_terminal_cmd
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_get_task
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_set_task_status
- mcp_supabase
- mcp_convex
- mcp_stripe

## Result We Want
- Complete backend development environment with functional server, dependency management, and environment configuration successfully initialized and verified.

## Add to Brain
- Backend Architecture: Scalable server-side architecture
- API Implementation: RESTful and GraphQL APIs
- Database Integration: Optimized database design
- Security Framework: Authentication, authorization, and data protection

## Tasks (Summary)
- Initialize backend project structure and install core dependencies
- Configure development server and environment variables
- Verify backend environment functionality

## Subtasks (Detailed)
### Subtask-01: Development Environment Initialization
- **Agent**: @coding-agent
- **Documentation Links**: Backend_Environment_Setup.md, Server_Configuration.json
- **Steps**:
    1. Initialize backend project structure and install core dependencies (run_terminal_cmd)
        - Success: Exit Code 0, package.json or requirements.txt, node_modules/ or venv/, "Successfully installed"
    2. Configure development server and environment variables (edit_file)
        - Success: scripts.dev, scripts.start, .env.example
    3. Verify backend environment functionality (run_terminal_cmd)
        - Success: Exit Code 0, GET http://localhost:8000/health returns 200 OK, "Server running on port"
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: Complete backend development environment with functional server, dependency management, and environment configuration successfully initialized and verified.
- **Integration Points**: Enables all subsequent backend development tasks including API creation, database integration, and testing.
- **Next Subtask**: P04-T01-S02 (Framework Integration & Middleware Setup)

### Subtask-02: Framework Integration & Middleware Setup
- **Agent**: @coding-agent
- **Documentation Links**: Framework_Configuration_Guide.md, Middleware_Setup.json
- **Steps**:
    1. Configure backend framework and routing system (edit_file)
        - Success: src/routes/ or routes/, "router", "middleware"
    2. Integrate error handling and logging middleware (edit_file)
        - Success: "error.*handler", "logging", "cors"
    3. Verify framework integration and middleware functionality (run_terminal_cmd)
        - Success: Exit Code 0, GET http://localhost:8000/api/test returns 200 OK, "Framework successfully configured"
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: Framework integration completed with functional middleware, routing system, and error handling verified and operational.
- **Integration Points**: Foundation for API development, request processing, and scalable server architecture.
- **Next Subtask**: P04-T02-S01 (API Architecture Design)

## Rollback Procedures
- Revert to previous environment configuration
- Reinstall dependencies
- Restore from backup if initialization fails

## Integration Points
- Enables all subsequent backend development tasks

## Quality Gates
- Functional server startup
- Dependency management
- Environment configuration

## Success Criteria
- Backend environment initialized
- Server runs successfully
- Dependencies installed
- Environment variables configured

## Risk Mitigation
- Use version control for configuration files
- Validate environment with test endpoints
- Document all setup steps

## Output Artifacts
- package.json or requirements.txt
- node_modules/ or venv/
- .env.example
- Server configuration files

## Next Action
Initialize backend project structure and install core dependencies

## Post-Completion Action
Proceed to P04-S13-T02-API-Architecture-and-Endpoint-Design.md
