## Mission Statement
Implement comprehensive database integration with ORM configuration, data models, and migration systems for scalable data management.

## Description
This task covers the configuration of database connection, ORM integration, data model definitions, migration system, and data seeding for scalable and maintainable data management.

## Super-Prompt
You are @coding-agent. Your mission is to implement database integration, ORM setup, data models, migration system, and data seeding for DafnckMachine v3.1 backend.

## MCP Tools Required
- edit_file
- run_terminal_cmd
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_get_task
- mcp_taskmaster-ai_set_task_status

## Result We Want
- Database integration completed with functional ORM, data models, migration system, and verified connectivity for data management operations.

## Add to Brain
- Database Integration: Optimized database design, ORM configuration, data modeling, migration system, data seeding

## Subtasks (Detailed)
### Subtask-01: Database Integration & ORM Setup
- **Agent**: @coding-agent
- **Documentation Links**: Database_Integration_Guide.md, ORM_Configuration.json
- **Steps**:
    1. Configure database connection and ORM integration (edit_file)
        - Success: "database", "connection", "pool"
    2. Define data models and schema structure (edit_file)
        - Success: "model", "schema", "relationship"
    3. Test database connectivity and ORM functionality (run_terminal_cmd)
        - Success: Exit Code 0, "Database connected", database-integration-test-suite
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: Database integration completed with functional ORM, data models, and verified connectivity for data management operations.
- **Integration Points**: Provides data persistence foundation for all application features and API endpoints.
- **Next Subtask**: P04-T04-S02 (Migration System & Data Seeding)

### Subtask-02: Migration System & Data Seeding
- **Agent**: @coding-agent
- **Documentation Links**: Migration_System_Guide.md, Data_Seeding_Scripts.json
- **Steps**:
    1. Implement database migration system and version control (edit_file)
        - Success: "migration", "version", "rollback"
    2. Configure data seeding and initial data setup (edit_file)
        - Success: "seed", "initial.*data", "populate"
    3. Test migration system and data seeding functionality (run_terminal_cmd)
        - Success: Exit Code 0, "Migration completed", "Data seeded"
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: Migration system implemented with version control, data seeding capabilities, and verified functionality for database management.
- **Integration Points**: Enables database evolution and provides foundation for deployment and environment management.
- **Next Subtask**: P04-T05-S01 (Business Logic Implementation)

## Rollback Procedures
- Revert to previous database or ORM configuration
- Restore from backup if migration or seeding fails

## Integration Points
- Provides data persistence and management foundation for backend

## Quality Gates
- Database integration and migration system must be functional and tested

## Success Criteria
- Database integration, ORM, and migration system are functional, tested, and ready for development

## Risk Mitigation
- Use version control for all database and migration changes
- Validate with automated and manual tests

## Output Artifacts
- ORM configuration files
- Data model definitions
- Migration scripts
- Data seeding scripts
- Test results and logs

## Next Action
Configure database connection and ORM integration
