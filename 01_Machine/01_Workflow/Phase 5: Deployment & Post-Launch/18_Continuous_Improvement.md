### Post-Completion Actions:
- **Task Completion:** Upon successful completion of all subtasks within this tactical task (Task-[YY]), ensure the **@Step.json** and **@DNA.json** files are updated to reflect its `SUCCEEDED` status and any associated progress or outcomes.
- **Phase Completion:** Upon successful completion of all tactical tasks within this strategic phase (Phase-[XX]), ensure the **@Step.json** and **@DNA.json** files are comprehensively updated to reflect the phase's `SUCCEEDED` status.

How to Use This Template:

Phase (Strategic Level): This is the highest level, representing a major stage of your project (e.g., "Strategic Planning," "Backend Development").
Task (Tactical Level): Break down phases into manageable tasks. These are still high-level but more focused (e.g., "Backend Environment Setup").
Subtask (Operational Level): This is where the granular work happens. Each subtask should be a cohesive unit of work that an agent can execute and verify.
ID: Follow the P[XX]-T[YY]-S[ZZ] format for unique identification.
Description: Be clear and concise about the subtask's goal.
Prerequisites: Define dependencies explicitly. The MCP will use this to ensure sequential execution.
Agent Assignment: Specify which agent (by its capabilities) is best suited for this subtask. This allows the Orchestrator to dispatch correctly.
Documentation Links: Use the mdc: prefix for internal documentation links. This will help the agent (and humans) navigate the knowledge base.
Max Retries & On Failure: Crucial for robust error handling. Define how many attempts are allowed and what action to take if all retries fail.
Steps: This is the core of the atomic operations.
Step ID: Unique ID for each individual step (P[XX]-T[YY]-S[ZZ]-01).
Command: The instruction for the agent. Keep it as actionable as possible.
Tool: Explicitly state the tool the agent needs to use. This guides the agent's action and helps the MCP verify its capabilities.
Description: Detail what the step does.
Success Criteria: This is the most critical part for enforcement. Provide clear, objective, and machine-verifiable conditions. The MCP will use these to determine if a step has truly succeeded. Be specific about exit codes, file content, process status, API responses, or test results.
Final Subtask Success Criteria: A summary condition for the entire subtask, often confirming that all internal steps were successful.
Integration Points: Helps understand the flow and impact of completing this subtask.
Next Subtask: Explicitly define the next logical subtask to maintain flow.
By adhering to this structured markdown, your agentic coder will produce highly readable and, more importantly, machine-enforceable instructions for your MCP Orchestrator. This template directly supports the principles of atomic operations, explicit state management, and mandatory verification, paving the way for 100% agent adherence.
