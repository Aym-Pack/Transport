# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask 1: Monitoring Architecture Design
- **ID**: P05-S17-T01-S01
- **Description**: Design a comprehensive monitoring architecture, including the observability strategy, metrics collection plan, monitoring stack, and integration points.
- **Agent**: @health-monitor-agent
- **Documentation Links**:
  - [Monitoring_Architecture_Design.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_5/17_Monitoring_Analytics/Monitoring_Architecture_Design.md)
  - [Observability_Strategy.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_5/17_Monitoring_Analytics/Observability_Strategy.json)
- **Steps**:
  1. Design monitoring architecture: observability strategy, metrics collection, monitoring stack, integration points and document it in Monitoring_Architecture_Design.md
     - Tool: edit_file
     - Success Criteria:
       - File Exists: 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/17_Monitoring_Analytics/Monitoring_Architecture_Design.md
       - File Content Matches: Contains sections for 'Observability Strategy', 'Metrics Collection', 'Monitoring Stack', and 'Integration Points'
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: The Monitoring_Architecture_Design.md document comprehensively details the monitoring architecture, including observability strategy, metrics collection, monitoring stack, and integration points.
- **Integration Points**: This designed architecture serves as the blueprint for all subsequent monitoring setup and analytics configurations.
- **Next Subtask**: P05-S17-T01-S02

## Subtask 2: Monitoring Infrastructure Setup
- **ID**: P05-S17-T01-S02
- **Description**: Set up the core monitoring infrastructure, including deploying the chosen monitoring platform, configuring data collection agents, and establishing data storage and scalability plans.
- **Agent**: @health-monitor-agent
- **Documentation Links**:
  - [Monitoring_Infrastructure_Setup.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_5/17_Monitoring_Analytics/Monitoring_Infrastructure_Setup.md)
  - [Platform_Configuration.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_5/17_Monitoring_Analytics/Platform_Configuration.json)
- **Steps**:
  1. Configure monitoring platform settings in Platform_Configuration.json
     - Tool: edit_file
     - Success Criteria:
       - File Exists: 01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_5/17_Monitoring_Analytics/Platform_Configuration.json
       - File Content Matches: Contains configuration for 'platformDeployment', 'dataCollection', 'storage', 'scalability'
  2. Deploy monitoring platform based on Platform_Configuration.json and Monitoring_Infrastructure_Setup.md
     - Tool: run_terminal_cmd
     - Success Criteria:
       - Exit Code: 0
       - Output Contains: Monitoring platform deployment successful
       - Process Running: monitoring_platform_service_name
- **Final Subtask Success Criteria**: The monitoring infrastructure is fully set up, the platform is deployed, data collection is active, storage is configured, and scalability measures are in place as per documentation.
- **Integration Points**: A functional monitoring infrastructure enables the collection of all necessary data for APM, user analytics, and other monitoring activities.
- **Next Subtask**: P05-S17-T02-S01
