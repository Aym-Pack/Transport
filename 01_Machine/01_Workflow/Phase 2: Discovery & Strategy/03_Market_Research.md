        * **Action:** Document the `Monetization_Framework.md` and populate `Pricing_Strategy_Analysis.json` with a structured overview of recommended pricing models, competitive benchmarks, and monetization options.
        * **Agent Prompt:** "Document the recommended monetization framework in `Monetization_Framework.md`. Populate `Pricing_Strategy_Analysis.json` with a structured overview of recommended pricing models, including competitive benchmarks, assessed pricing sensitivity, and a breakdown of viable monetization options."
        * **Success Criteria:**
            * **Document Exists:** `Monetization_Framework.md` and `Pricing_Strategy_Analysis.json` are created/updated.
            * **Content Quality:** `Monetization_Framework.md` describes the chosen pricing strategy and rationale. `Pricing_Strategy_Analysis.json` contains a JSON object with `recommended_pricing_model`, `competitive_benchmarks` (list), `pricing_sensitivity_assessment`, and `monetization_options` (list of at least 2).
            * **Format Validation:** `Pricing_Strategy_Analysis.json` is a valid JSON document.
        * **Verification Steps:**
            * Verify both documents exist and are non-empty.
            * Perform string search in `Monetization_Framework.md` for pricing strategy.
            * Parse `Pricing_Strategy_Analysis.json` and check for structure and content.
            * Run JSON schema validation.
* **Subtask Success Criteria:** A comprehensive pricing strategy is documented with a recommended pricing model.
* **Integration Points:** Pricing strategy will directly inform the business model, revenue projections, and overall financial viability of the project.
* **Next Subtask:** `P02-T08-S01` (Market Research Consolidation)
