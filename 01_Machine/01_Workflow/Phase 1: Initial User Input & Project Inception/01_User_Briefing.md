  - [Briefing_Summary.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_1_Initial_User_Input/Briefing_Summary.md)
  - [Requirements_Matrix.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_1_Initial_User_Input/Requirements_Matrix.json)
- Max Retries: 2
- On Failure: `ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN (@project-manager)` with identified inconsistencies.
- Steps:
    - Step ID: P01-T06-S01-01
      - Command: `Consolidate all information gathered from previous tasks into a single, cohesive 'Briefing_Summary.md'. Actively identify any inconsistencies or gaps between the documents. Confirm and document the overall project priorities based on this synthesis.`
      - Tool: `edit_file` (Primary), `internal_knowledge_synthesis` (Supporting)
      - Description: Review and synthesize all information gathered in `P01-T01` through `P01-T05`. Identify `inconsistencies`, `gaps`, and confirm `priorities`. Compile a cohesive `Briefing_Summary.md`.
      - Success Criteria:
          - File Exists: `Briefing_Summary.md`
          - File Content Matches: `Briefing_Summary.md` provides a high-level summary of all previous tasks, explicitly mentioning identified `gaps` or `inconsistencies` (if any) and a confirmed list of top 5 `priorities`. The summary logically connects information.
          - Internal Agent Log: Internal consistency checks between documents have been performed and documented.
- Final Subtask Success Criteria: A complete and validated briefing synthesis is documented in `Briefing_Summary.md`.
- Integration Points: The consolidated briefing will guide all subsequent workflow phases, acting as the primary source of truth for the project.
- Next Subtask: P01-T06-S02

### Subtask-02 (Operational Level) - User Confirmation
- ID: P01-T06-S02
- Description: Presenting the briefing summary to the user for confirmation and scope finalization.
- Prerequisites: Subtask P01-T06-S01 must be `SUCCEEDED`.
- Agent Assignment: `@nlu-processor-agent` - Primary capabilities: `validation`, `confirmation`, `user-interaction`, `document-editing`.
- Documentation Links:
  - [Briefing_Summary.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_1_Initial_User_Input/Briefing_Summary.md)
  - [User_Confirmation_Log.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/Doc/Phase_1_Initial_User_Input/User_Confirmation_Log.md) (New Document)
- Max Retries: 3 (for user response)
- On Failure: `ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN (@project-manager)` if user confirmation cannot be obtained.
- Steps:
    - Step ID: P01-T06-S02-01
      - Command: `Present the finalized 'Briefing_Summary.md' to the user. Explicitly ask for their confirmation of understanding, validation of all documented requirements, and seek resolution for any concerns. Obtain and record their final agreement on the project's scope boundaries. Document this interaction and outcome in 'User_Confirmation_Log.md'.`
      - Tool: `user_interaction_prompt` (Primary), `edit_file` (Supporting)
      - Description: Present the `Briefing_Summary.md` to the user. Prompt for `confirmation`, `validation`, address `concerns`, and seek `finalization of scope`. Record interaction in `User_Confirmation_Log.md`.
      - Success Criteria:
          - User Interaction Log: User provides explicit confirmation (e.g., "I confirm the briefing is accurate," or "Approved") of the briefing's accuracy and completeness.
          - File Exists: `User_Confirmation_Log.md`
          - File Content Matches: `User_Confirmation_Log.md` contains a timestamped entry detailing the interaction, user's confirmation/feedback, and explicit scope finalization statement.
- Final Subtask Success Criteria: Explicit user confirmation of the briefing's accuracy and completeness is obtained and documented.
- Integration Points: The confirmed briefing becomes the definitive foundation for defining the project scope and proceeding to subsequent phases.
- Next Subtask: None
