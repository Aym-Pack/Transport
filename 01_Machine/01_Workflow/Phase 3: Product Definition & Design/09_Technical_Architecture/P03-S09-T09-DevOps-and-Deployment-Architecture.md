# Subtasks (Detailed)
## Subtask-01: CI/CD Pipeline Design
- **ID**: P03-T09-S01
- **Description**: Design the CI/CD pipeline, including build automation, testing integration, deployment automation, and rollback procedures.
- **Agent Assignment**: @devops-agent (cicd-design, automation-pipeline)
- **Documentation Links**:
  - [DevOps_Pipeline_Specifications.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/DevOps_Pipeline_Specifications.md)
  - [CICD_Automation_Plan.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/CICD_Automation_Plan.json)
- **Steps**:
  1. Design CI/CD pipeline: select CI/CD tools, define stages, automate build processes, integrate automated testing, automate deployment, manage environment-specific configurations, and plan rollback procedures (CognitiveProcessing)
  2. Document the CI/CD pipeline specifications in DevOps_Pipeline_Specifications.md (edit_file)
  3. Outline the CI/CD automation plan in CICD_Automation_Plan.json (edit_file)
- **Success Criteria**:
  - A comprehensive CI/CD pipeline design, including automation plans and deployment management strategies, is documented.
  - InternalState: CI/CD pipeline designed.
- **Integration Points**: This pipeline enables an efficient development workflow, rapid feedback loops, and reliable, automated deployment processes.
- **Next Subtask**: P03-T09-S02

## Subtask-02: Environment Management & Configuration
- **ID**: P03-T09-S02
- **Description**: Design the environment management strategy, including environment configuration, secrets management, configuration as code, environment parity, and deployment strategies.
- **Agent Assignment**: @devops-agent (environment-management, configuration-design)
- **Documentation Links**:
  - [Environment_Management_Strategy.md](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/Environment_Management_Strategy.md)
  - [Configuration_Management_Plan.json](mdc:01_Machine/04_Documentation/vision/Phase_3/09_Technical_Architecture/Configuration_Management_Plan.json)
- **Steps**:
  1. Design environment management strategy: define processes for provisioning and managing environments, implement secure secrets management, adopt configuration as code, ensure environment parity, and select deployment strategies (CognitiveProcessing)
  2. Document the environment management strategy in Environment_Management_Strategy.md (edit_file)
  3. Detail the configuration management plan in Configuration_Management_Plan.json (edit_file)
- **Success Criteria**:
  - A comprehensive environment management strategy, including configuration control and deployment approaches, is documented.
  - InternalState: Environment management strategy designed.
- **Integration Points**: This strategy ensures consistent, secure, and manageable environments across the application lifecycle, supporting reliable deployments.
- **Next Subtask**: None
